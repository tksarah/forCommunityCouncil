## Title
Proposal for dApp Staking Code of Conduct


## Context

It has been several years since the dApp Staking system has been operational within the community. During this time, while many projects have utilized the system, several issues have been raised and discussed within the community. Among these, there are voices calling for changes to the dApp Staking system. In light of this situation, the community council has recognized the need for a solid and logical framework that leads the growth of the Astar ecosystem by first correctly understanding and organizing the basics.

## Overveiw

One of the main responsibilities of the Community Council is the management of dApp Staking. As part of this effort, they started by clarifying the guidelines for dApp Staking. This allowed the Community Council to organize the code of conduct for projects participating in dApp Staking.

This proposal is being shared to gather feedback from within the community before it is published as an official document.

**Considerations:**

*The Community Council understands that the items in this code of conduct do not completely resolve all the issues raised within the community so far. Additionally, there are some related items that still leave room for discussion. Therefore, based on opinions and feedback from the community, minor adjustments may be made before the official publication, but items deemed to require sufficient discussion will be maintained as ongoing issues.*

**Feedback Period:**

*Until February 14th*

# dApp Staking Code of Conduct

This is the Code of Conduct for Astar's dApp Staking. It is a set of rules and guidelines that all participants in dApp Staking should follow. This Code of Conduct aims to ensure that dApp Staking is fair, transparent, and efficient. However, nothing is set in stone, and it may be changed in the future.

|  # | Classification | Guidelines |
|----| ------- | ------------|
|  1 | Introduction | Users need to fully understand how dApp Staking works before using it. This can be done, for example, by reading [official documentation](https://docs.astar.network/docs/learn/dapp-staking/) or [blogs](https://astar.network/blog). |
|  2 | Definitions and Terminology | dApp Staking is not a funding or charity mechanism. Projects must be self-sustaining regardless of staking rewards.<p>In this context, "self-sufficiency" means that while dApp Staking helps in launching and supporting the development of projects, it should not be the primary source of long-term revenue for the project. In other words, the project needs to be sustainable even without dApp Staking rewards. If additional funding is required, it must be sought from other sources. |
|  3 | Purpose | dApp Staking is designed to support a sustainable ecosystem.<p>Projects should not promise financial gains to supporters through staking rewards without creating contributing contribution to Astar Growth with concrete results and onchain metrics. <p> Projects should use the dApp Staking mechanism to serve more users and add more value to the network.<p> The following on-chain metrics can contribute to asses induced the growth of Astar Network. <p> Examples for  DeFi projects:<ul><li>TVL (Total Value Locked)</li><li>Transaction volume (per unit time)</li><li> Generated fees (per unit time)</li><li>Wallets</li><li>Revenue</li><li>Mcap</li></ul><p>Examples for  NFT projects:<ul><li>Floor price (in $)</li><li>Total volume on marketplace</li><li>Percentage of collection for sale</li><li>Number of holders</li></ul>|
|  4 | Compliance Requirements | Projects should not use dApp Staking as a â€œBusiness Model". |
|  5 | Definitions and Scope | dApp Staking is not a grant program. Therefore, when listing, there must be an existing and ongoing business. Specifically, at the time of listing for dApp Staking, there should already be a product or service(a live product or MVP) available. for users to utilize,  as well as sufficient documentation  to provid token holders with the necessary information to make a voting decision.<br><br>dApp Staking is a decentralized incentive mechanism which mean that, instead of a central authority distributing funds, token holders stake their tokens to support projects, which earn rewards based on that support. Grants program provide one-time or periodic funding, while dApp Staking offers ongoing rewards driven by community engagement. Projects must continuously attract support to sustain funding, making it performance-based rather than an upfront allocation.<br><br>On the other hand, the [UCG (Unstoppable Community Grants)](https://docs.astar.network/docs/use/governance/unstoppable-community-grant-program) program is a funding initiative to boost early-stage dApps within the Astar ecosystem. It provides a staking-based grant of up to 17M ASTR from the Community Treasury over 4 months, with a possible one-time 4-month renewal. The program aligns with dApp Staking V3, using a tier system where, if a dApp in [UCG](https://docs.astar.network/docs/use/governance/unstoppable-community-grant-program) reaches Tier 2, the grant is terminated.<br>For seed projects (project without MVP or live product) or grant programs, please refer to [UCG](https://docs.astar.network/docs/use/governance/unstoppable-community-grant-program).|
|  6 | Reporting and Monitoring | All projects participating in dApp Staking are strongly encouraged to regularly report their ongoing contributions to the Astar Network ecosystem.<p> <ul><li>Reports should be submitted in the [Astar Forum](https://forum.astar.network/) under the "Governance -> dApp Staking Reports" subcategories.</li><li>While monthly reports are desirable, if this is difficult, please indicate the interval at which you can report and adhere to that schedule.</li><li>The content of the reports is left to the discretion of the project and does not need to be detailed; however, it should at least include the following:</li><ul><li>Project progress</li><li>Roadmap</li><li>Activities and outcomes since the previous report</li><li>Quantitative results (as much as possible)</li></ul><li>Especially for projects in Tier 4, regular reporting is important for ensuring that the community recognizes, understands, and supports their activities. Therefore, at least monthly reporting is desirable.</li><li>Reviews and feedback on the reports will be conducted by the community, with active involvement from Astar Ecosystem Agents in particular.</li><li>The community can issue warnings to projects that have not reported for three months (or three times according to the project's specified schedule). If there is no response three months after the initial warning (or three times according to the project's specified schedule), the council can propose delisting the project.</li></ul> |
|  7 | Evaluating Negative Impacts | To determine whether something is negatively impacting the Astar ecosystem or not providing value, any community member can initiate a discussion on the [Astar Forum](https://forum.astar.network/).<br><br> If proofs that project behavior impact negatively the Astar Network and/or dApp staking programm, in reputation and/or financially, are uncovered, project will be issed a warning.<br><br> When a warning is issued in this fashion, the project will be given 60 days to take proper actions to resolve the issue and/or correct its behavior. <br><br> Following this periode, if the situation has not improved and the project can not provide reasonable explanation of why, the council will initiat a delisting proposal.<br><br> If the project is delisted in such fashion, it can apply to be listed again, but it must clearly demonstrate that the previously unaddressed issues have been resolved.<br><br> Examples of inappropriate behavior and actions that negatively impact the Astar ecosystem:<ul><li>Lack of transparency with the community</li><li>Failure to meet the deadlines specified in the guidelines or by the Council/Community</li><li>Insufficient engagement on social media and absence of updates</li><li>Restrictive communication confined to the dApp's community (e.g., Discord) instead of being open to the entire Astar community on the Forum</li><li>Migration to another ecosystem that does not benefit Astar</li><li>Misuse of dApp staking resources to fund projects outside the Astar ecosystem</li><li>Exploiting the community (TGE, Liquidity, NFTs, etc.)</li></ul> |
|  8 | dApp Categories | Clearly specify the main category of the dApp (such as NFT, DeFi, Tool, Utility, etc.).<p>The current main categories are as follows:<ul><li>DeFi (Including LST, Lending, DEX, GameFi, ) </li><li>NFT  (Including Digital Art, Collectibles, Music and Concert Tickets, Digital Identity and Certificates, RWA,)</li><li>Tooling (Including Infrastructure, Bridge, Oracle, ) </li><li>Utility (Including Wallets, ) </li><li>SocialFi </li><li>AI (Including "AI Agent", DeFAI, ) </li><li>IoT </li><li>DAO </li><li>DePin </li><li>Stablecoin </li><li>Entertainment (Includinf Game, Metaverse, P2E, ) </li></ul> <br>To make it easy to identify the type of dApp, please avoid using the "other" category. If a new category is needed, you can propose it on the [Astar Forum](https://forum.astar.network/) and start an additional discussion.|
|  9 | Definitions | dApp Staking is not a program of legitimization. <p> While a screening is performed by the council and the community priore to listing, being listed on dApp Staking itself does not imply blind official trust.  Project must constantly earn and foster this trust through consistant work and report to community.  |
| 10 | Method for dApp Listing Determination | The listing of dApps for dApp Staking can be determined through the following methods: <br><br>**Community Council:**<br>Projects can apply for listing on dApp Staking through the [Astar Forum](https://forum.astar.network/).The Community Council will review and make a decision within approximately two weeks after the projectâ€™s application. If the application is approved, the Community Council will whitelist the project to be registered in dApp Staking.<br><br>**Token Holders:**<br>Projects can create a public proposal on [Subsquare](https://astar.subsquare.io/) to register their dApp in dApp Staking. This proposal will be upgraded to a referendum and voted on by token holders. If approved, it will be executed on-chain.<br><br>For more details on application requirements and the submission template, please refer to the dApp Staking - [For Devs](https://docs.astar.network/docs/use/dapp-staking/for-devs/) section. |
