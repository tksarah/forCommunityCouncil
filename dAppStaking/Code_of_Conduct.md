## Title
Proposal for dApp Staking Code of Conduct


## Context

It has been several years since the dApp Staking system has been operational within the community. During this time, while many projects have utilized the system, several issues have been raised and discussed within the community. Among these, there are voices calling for changes to the dApp Staking system. In light of this situation, the community council has recognized the need for a solid and logical framework that leads the growth of the Astar ecosystem by first correctly understanding and organizing the basics.

## Overveiw

One of the main responsibilities of the Community Council is the management of dApp Staking. As part of this effort, they started by clarifying the guidelines for dApp Staking. This allowed the Community Council to organize the code of conduct for projects participating in dApp Staking.

This proposal is being shared to gather feedback from within the community before it is published as an official document.

**Considerations**

*The Community Council understands that the items in this code of conduct do not completely resolve all the issues raised within the community so far. Additionally, there are some related items that still leave room for discussion. Therefore, based on opinions and feedback from the community, minor adjustments may be made before the official publication, but items deemed to require sufficient discussion will be maintained as ongoing issues.*

**Feedback Period:**

*Until February 14th*

# dApp Staking Code of Conduct

This is the Code of Conduct for Astar's dApp Staking. It is a set of rules and guidelines that all participants in dApp Staking should follow. This Code of Conduct aims to ensure that dApp Staking is fair, transparent, and efficient. However, nothing is set in stone, and it may be changed in the future.

|  1 | Users need to fully understand how dApp Staking works before using it. This can be done, for example, by reading [official documentation](https://docs.astar.network/docs/learn/dapp-staking/) or [blogs](https://astar.network/blog). |
|  2 | dApp Staking is not a funding or charity mechanism. Projects must be self-sustaining regardless of staking rewards.
In this context, "self-sufficiency" means that while dApp Staking helps in launching and supporting the development of projects, it should not be the primary source of long-term revenue for the project. In other words, the project needs to be sustainable even without dApp Staking rewards. If additional funding is required, it must be sought from other sources. |
|  3 | dApp Staking is designed to support a sustainable ecosystem.<p>Projects should not promise financial gains to supporters through staking rewards without creating contributing contribution to Astar Growth with concrete results and onchain metrics. <p> Projects should use the dApp Staking mechanism to serve more users and add more value to the network.<br><br> The following on-chain metrics can contribute to asses induced the growth of Astar Network. <br><br> Examples for  Defi projects:<ul><li>TVL (Total Value Locked)</li><li>Transaction volume (per unit time)</li><li> Generated fees (per unit time)</li><li>Wallets</li><li>Revenue</li><li>Mcap</li></ul><br><br>Examples for  NFT projects:<ul><li>Floor price (in $)</li><li>Total volume on marketplace</li><li>Percentage of collection for sale</li><li>Number of holders</li></ul>|
