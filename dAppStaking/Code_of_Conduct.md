## Title
Proposal for dApp Staking Code of Conduct


## Context

It has been several years since the dApp Staking system has been operational within the community. During this time, while many projects have utilized the system, several issues have been raised and discussed within the community. Among these, there are voices calling for changes to the dApp Staking system. In light of this situation, the community council has recognized the need for a solid and logical framework that leads the growth of the Astar ecosystem by first correctly understanding and organizing the basics.

## Overveiw

One of the main responsibilities of the Community Council is the management of dApp Staking. As part of this effort, they started by clarifying the guidelines for dApp Staking. This allowed the Community Council to organize the code of conduct for projects participating in dApp Staking.

This proposal is being shared to gather feedback from within the community before it is published as an official document.

**Considerations**

*The Community Council understands that the items in this code of conduct do not completely resolve all the issues raised within the community so far. Additionally, there are some related items that still leave room for discussion. Therefore, based on opinions and feedback from the community, minor adjustments may be made before the official publication, but items deemed to require sufficient discussion will be maintained as ongoing issues.*

**Feedback Period:**

*Until February 14th*
