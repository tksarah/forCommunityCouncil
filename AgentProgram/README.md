# Astar Ecosystem Agent Program 2.5

**Objective:** This document aims to provide an update to the current Astar Ecosystem Agent program following the launch of on-chain governance and the transition of Astar Network to Astar Collective.

## Introduction
As Astar Network evolves beyond being a standalone blockchain protocol into a comprehensive ecosystem that bridges Web2 and Web3, we are thrilled to announce a series of updates to the Astar Ecosystem Agent Program. This transformation aligns with Astar’s partnership with Soneium, powered by Sony Block Solutions Labs, and our collective mission to drive Web3 adoption at a massive scale.


Our agents will play an essential role in promoting this expanded vision, supporting both Astar Network and the Soneium ecosystem. Together, we aim to reach billions of users by integrating Web3 capabilities with mainstream consumer applications.


This update is closely tied to our transition to on-chain governance on Astar, which introduces a new Community Council responsible for overseeing and approving agent compensation through a transparent and decentralized system. The Community Council will play a crucial role in evaluating agent contributions and ensuring the Community Treasury is managed effectively, marking a new era of community-driven decision-making.

## On-Chain Governance
As the Astar Network transitions to on-chain governance, significant changes are being implemented to enhance transparency, efficiency, and community-driven decision-making for the Astar Ecosystem Agent Program. Here's an outline of the new structure:

### 1. Transition to On-Chain Governance:

* The management and approval of token compensations to Astar agents will now fall under the responsibility of the newly formed Community Council.
* The Community Council will consist of Startale team members, Astar ecosystem agents, and engaged community members, ensuring diverse representation and oversight.

### 2. Key Changes:

* **Evaluation and Remuneration Structure:** The existing evaluation process, previously managed by Startale, will be removed. Instead, agents will be compensated through a decentralized and transparent process.
* **Community Council’s Role:** The council will be responsible for assessing and approving compensation requests made by agents, known as “Tips,” through on-chain community treasury proposals.

## New Compensation Model: Tips Proposal System
The Tips Compensation Model is a community-driven approach designed to reward Astar Ecosystem Agents transparently and fairly. Instead of receiving automatic payments, agents can submit “Tips” proposals to the Community Treasury once per quarter. Each proposal should specify the requested amount and provide a detailed justification of past contributions, such as community engagement, content creation, event organization, or technical support.


These proposals are then reviewed and approved by the Community Council, ensuring that compensation is merit-based and aligned with the ecosystem's impact goals. This model promotes accountability, transparency, and community involvement, empowering and rewarding agents to contribute meaningfully while keeping the ecosystem sustainable.

### How the Tips Proposal System Works:

* **Agents Seeking Compensation:** Agents will submit Tip proposals to the Community Treasury.
* **Frequency:** Agents can submit one Tip proposal per quarter.
* **Proposal Requirements:** Each Tip proposal must include: 
  - The amount requested for compensation.
  - A justification detailing contributions made during the quarter, with specific evidence of impact and results. The proposer must have a verified on-chain identity.
* **Approval Process:** The Community Council will review each proposal, deliberate on the contributions made, and decide if the compensation is justified.

### Role of Startale Under the New System:

* **Oversight and Support:** Startale will continue to manage the Astar Ecosystem Agent Program by:
  - Handling new member applications.
  - Providing support and guidance to agents.
  - Promoting agents and their contributions on Astar's official channels and platforms.
  - Managing agent privileges, such as event invitations and direct access to the team.
* **Note:** Startale will no longer be involved in evaluating agent contributions for compensation purposes.

## Updated Program: Alignment with Astar Collective

With Astar’s evolution from a blockchain protocol into a dynamic and inclusive collective, the Astar Ecosystem Agent Program has been restructured to align with the broader vision of driving Web3 adoption and real-world use cases. Agents will continue to play a critical role in this transformative journey by promoting and supporting the ecosystem's expansion, especially as Astar integrates with Soneium and the broader Superchain ecosystem.
